# Sherlock Confetti

Sherlock Confetti is a lightweight program that displays a confetti animation
as a top-level overlay on Wayland compositors. It provides a fun and colorful
visual effect without interfering with your workflow.

## Features

- **Wayland-native:** Built specifically for Wayland environments.
- **Tiling Window Manager Friendly:** Displays on top without disrupting your
  window layout.
- **High-performance rendering with WGPU:** Utilizes GPU acceleration for
  smooth animation.
- **Shader-driven confetti:** Custom shaders deliver rich, dynamic visual
  effects.
- **Multiple Color Palettes:** Choose from a variety of predefined vibrant and
  pastel palettes.
- **Standalone or Integrated:** Originally created for the custom launcher
  [Sherlock](https://github.com/Skxxtz/sherlock), but fully functional as a
  standalone program.

## Usage

Simply run the program to enjoy confetti animations on your Wayland session. It
can be integrated or triggered by other applications such as launchers or
window managers.
